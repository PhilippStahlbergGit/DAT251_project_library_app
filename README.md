# Branching rules
* __production__:
  The production ready branch, fixes and new versions should be properly explained and made clear.

**Note:** production branch is protected by default (meaning every push has to have a PR request) at least *some* members must accept the PR for it to be a changed.
* __testing__
Make a new branch (e.g for a new feature add feature/name_of_feature) for any feature, fixes or any other *improvements* then merge it into the testing branch and delete the old branch.
